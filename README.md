# gsheetsbot
A small project to create a Telegram bot that interacts with Google Sheets

This script is run on Google Scripts

## Resources
* [The utilized Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aChvreatc2_in1ZPchH0TAJ1vdyH241BnxPNMLyJZbQ/edit?usp=sharing)

## Current Features
* Appending information into gsheets from telegram bot chat
* Extracting information from gsheets to telegram bot chat
* Dynamic Inline Keyboard based on number of items in specified column in gsheets
* Pseudo-chatbot guided-reply system to obtain information from user for logging into the gsheets 

## Future Plans
* To Do List that is interactable (whether task is done or not)
* Method to keep private chat clean (either through deletion of messages or editing of inlinekeyboard)
* Retrieval of specific expenditure by category or date
* Expand on other possible uses of Telegram Bot with Google Scripts (focusing on gsheets)
